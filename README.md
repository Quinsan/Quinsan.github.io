## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Testing out Markdown syntax, nothing to see here.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It's pretty neat. This page uses Jekyll theme, and this is easy to change.

> I have no idea what I'm doing.
> - Computer dog (or in this case me)


Some example of using text styles and linking a page here:

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. Link to my own project [here!](https://quinsan.github.io/robofriends/)

### Lists

A numbered list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
4. Item 4 You

Shooting some bullets:

* This is a bullet
* We have a badass over me!

Or just dashes

- Heya there
  - We work on many levels 


Heres some code:

Look, a line of code: `var line = code`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (code){
      return many lines
    }

This is cool!

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

Maybe it's time to mark this as done!!!

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
    
Well thats something!!!
